# Apartment_Market_Analysis

In this project, I web scraped and parsed listing available high-rated apartments within 2 miles around Boston Univeristy Center from apartments.com, analyzed price, vacancy, special promotions against different room types, and discovered the price and availability trends in 2021.

Also, a rent roll was introduced in this project in Part 2 and I proposed operation solutions with diagrams and statistical modeling to achieve a 25% profit growth for landlord and a 5% net margin for property management firm.
